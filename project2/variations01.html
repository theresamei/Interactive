<p>PANCAKE?<br> by Shel Silverstein<Br><br> Who wants a pancake,<br>
Sweet and piping hot?<br>
Good little Grace looks up and says,<br>
&quot;I&#39;ll take the one on top.&quot;<br>
Who else wants a pancake,<br>
Fresh off the griddle?<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrible Theresa smiles and says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll take the one in the middle.&quot;<br>
