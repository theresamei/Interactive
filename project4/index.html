	“Art appears when what is made feels as if there is a profound misunderstanding at the heart of what it is, as if it were made with the wrong use in mind, or the wrong idea about what it is capable of, or simply the wrong set of assumptions about what it means to fully function in the world. A work works by not working at all. By not obeying the law of any system or authority external to the process of its own making, a work emphatically expresses its own right to exist for itself and in itself, and questions — by merely existing — the rule of law that works to bind all to semblance of the common good. Art is a lawless proposition.” Do you agree with Chan’s definition of art? Do you think this can be extended to design as well?

		What strikes as interesting from Chan’s definition of art is that art works with no governance, except for its own self as art. Successful art is when art itself is “not working.” Art should deconstruct our daily commonalities, norms, conformities. The artist is working with inner laws or “inner tendencies,” where these constraints activate the core of an artist. Designers functions on a similar level; constraints for the designer are more unbinding than working with absolute freedom. In design, there is a particularity when designing with constraints, running on its own set of rules. In many ways, this is lawless in itself. For a designer to curate a specific set of “inner tendencies,” the design then leaves room for its audience or user to navigate within his or her own set of inner tendencies. This portrays a sense of democracy. However, whether the design is successful or unsuccessful, that is open to interpretation. In correlation to Paul’s definition and how it may extend to design, Jack Balkin and Dan Michaelson’s interview, Balkin concludes with, “So when you apprehend Google, the page, what you see before you is a clean page that appears to put you in the driver’s seat. It creates the image of your empowerment. It’s not just a question of incentives. It’s a question of what the Google page means to you.”
