<p><i>The Store</i> is an interior that suggest the unconscious, an intimate, personal "elsewhere." It is enclosed upon itself, like a body and its organs. To experience it, one must anatomize it, proceeding by cuts and snips, in order to define its heterogeneous whole in all its details. One must enter its cavity to discover its spectacular, dramatic external articulation. In this sense, it is the container of a strange human anthropology enacted by the scraps and figures which lay bare the artist's obsessions.</p>
<p><i>I have always felt the need of correspondence between one's art and one's life. I feel my purpose is to say something about my times...for me this involves a recreation of my vision of the times...my reality, or my drama-reality, and this demands a form of a theatrical nature...like the film or theatre. It is not a challenge to or a development of painting, but another form.... I am making symbols of my time through my experience...and do not really recognize a rest period or a period out of my experience, as most do...i.e., a period of raising children or establishing a home or whatever might be done as if outside the vision...for me there is no "outside vision" except this special undefined outside of myself as spectator of myself...every instant is the drama and my art is the record or evidence.</i></p>
<p>It is an attempt to see and live the city, and oneself, without detachment—not sociologically, but psychologically, as a collection of all the dregs of a sensual, sexual imaginary realm: as the labyrinth of desires.</p>
<p>In 1961, Oldenburg, with his Ray Gun Mfg. Co., moved into a store on 107 East Second Street. In December, he opened <i>The Store</i>, in which he presented his objects in a new <i>incarnation</i>. What mattered now was no longer the incorporeal—that is, the silhouette and its shadow, the phantom, drawing, two-dimensionality, and lightness—but materiality and gravity, carnality and sensuality, plasticity and tactility, the envelopes covering and feding the body. <i>The Store</i> is full of things like clothes and food, things related to libidinal practices, tools of a subjectivity oriented toward the assumption of the sexual other.</p>
<p><i>The Store</i> is filled with pieces of clothing, from stockings, pants, and garter belts to shoes, shirts, and panties. It is a hymn to the confusion between body and object, between drapery and the nude. Through color, the artist reveals the impetuous, vibrant thrill of visual desire, making the clothing shine like bodies in the sun. And while the artist rejects any connection with the mystical passage from fabric to flesh in Gianlorenzo Bernini, one can surely deduce a relation here to Peter Paul Rubens—who heightens the chromatic effects of skin and creates erotic passages between skin and fur and between clothing and surroundings—or to Diego Velazquez and Nicolas Poussin, who are obsessively concerned with the beauty of clothing, fabrics, and furs in their work. The difference is that Oldenburg mediates these lessons with the contemporary experience of the mass media.</p>
<p>For the entire period that <i>The Store</i> occupied its Lower East Side quarters, Oldenburg was present among his products, presenting himself as manufacturer and shopkeeper, a body attesting to the continuity between desire and commodity, flesh and plastic. An object moving among other objects, he travels about in the cavity of the impersonal as if wanting to underscore the fact of having given up his own organic nature. The artist devitalizes himself because he is aware that the human being is no longer capable of seeing and feeling himself as a "landscape," now that he has become part of the general landscape. He is an insert in a cavity that knows nothing of lived experience. He no longer belongs to himself, but only to the world, empty or full, in which he moves. He and it are the one same thing:</p>
<p><i>The store may be better understood if it is considered not itself a psychological statement, but a collection of psychological statements, which exist concretely in the form of the signs and advertisements....An imitation of nature or nature in the city, but nature altered toward psychology, which is to say: the true landscape of the city.</i></p>
<p>A hallucination where bodies are part of stores, the street, buildings. Indeed, they are mute figureheads of the epic of the inorganic:</p>
<p><i>Torn-birth-fragments: I think of space as being material like I think of the stage as being a solid cue or hollow box to be broken, so an hallucination basic to my work is of the continuity of matter, that air and the things in it are one, are HARD, and that you can RIP a piece of air and the thing in it out of it, so that a piece of object and a whole object and just air, come as one piece.</i></p>
<p><i>The Store</i> is a plastic landscape in which feeling has been estranged, displaced, broke, dehumanized, because it has achieved total autonomy. This is why the boundaries betweeen the artist and his products, between being and objects, is abolished in it. Unrelated objects are brought togther, objectivity and subjectivity merge. The Store is a womb one may enter through glass, or rather through the cold gaze of sign, the mental erotic: there is an equivalency with Duchamp's <i>Black Widow</i>. <i>The Store</i> is not only part of the history of art, but of the history of the city as well. It is a three-dimensional painting inscribed in the corridor of paintings that is East Second Street and its shop-windows. It is tangible space; its perspective is not illusory, but real. It is one shop window/painting among the rest. But is also one shop among the rest, a parody of an art gallery.</p>
