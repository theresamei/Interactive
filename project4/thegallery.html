<p>For the entire period that The Store occupied its Lower East Side quarters, Oldenburg was present among his products, presenting himself as manufacturer and shopkeeper, a body attesting to the continuity between desire and commodity, flesh and plastic. An object moving among other objects, he travels about in the cavity of the impersonal as if wanting to underscore the fact of having given up his own organic nature. The artist devitalizes himself because he is aware that the human being is no longer capable of seeing and feeling himself as a "landscape," now that he has become part of the general landscape. He is an insert in a cavity that knows nothing of lived experience. He no longer belongs to himself, but only to the world, empty or full, in which he moves. He and it are the one same thing:</p>
<p><i>The store may be better understood if it is considered not itself a psychological statement, but a collection of psychological statements, which exist concretely in the form of the signs and advertisements....An imitation of nature or nature in the city, but nature altered toward psychology, which is to say: the true landscape of the city.</i></p>
<p>A hallucination where bodies are part of stores, the street, buildings. Indeed, they are mute figureheads of the epic of the inorganic:</p>
<p><i>Torn-birth-fragments: I think of space as being material like I think of the stage as being a solid cue or hollow box to be broken, so an hallucination basic to my work is of the continuity of matter, that air and the things in it are one, are HARD, and that you can RIP a piece of air and the thing in it out of it, so that a piece of object and a whole object and just air, come as one piece.</i></p>
<p>The Store is a plastic landscape in which feeling has been estranged, displaced, broke, dehumanized, because it has achieved total autonomy. This is why the boundaries betweeen the artist and his products, between being and objects, is abolished in it. Unrelated objects are brought togther, objectivity and subjectivity merge. The Store is a womb one may enter through glass, or rather through the cold gaze of sign, the mental erotic: there is an equivalency with Duchamp's Black Widow. The Store is not only part of the history of art, but of the history of the city as well. It is a three-dimensional painting inscribed in the corridor of paintings that is East Second Street and its shop-windows. It is tangible space; its perspective is not illusory, but real. It is one shop window/painting among the rest. But is also one shop among the rest, a parody of an art gallery.</p>
